What I really appreciate is that when the kills start happening the film has a sense of urgency, people seem to be reacting in a timely manner, rather than just standing or sitting around for hours between each kill. The acting is better from most of the cast compared to the original as well (aside from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance).

Not trolling, I think this film genuinely does a better job of presenting Michael Myers as a threatening presence than the original. I know people don't like that it gives Michael a backstory, but I'm fine with it. What I really appreciate is that when the kills start happening the film has a sense of urgency, people seem to be reacting in a timely manner, rather than just standing or sitting around for hours between each kill. The acting is better from most of the cast compared to the original as well (aside from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance). I know the original is more of a proto-slasher, so I try to view it with that in mind, but it hasn't aged particularly well.</div></div><div id="thread-191575898" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4channel.org/tv/thread/191575898"><img loading="lazy" alt="" id="thumb-191575898" class="thumb" width="150" height="78.6" src="4chan_files/1698739086844213s.jpg" data-id="191575898"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mage Replies" id="meta-191575898" class="meta">R: <b>37</b> / I: <b>13</b><a href="https://boards.4channel.org/tv/catalog#" class="postMenuBtn" title="Thread Menu" data-post-menu="191575898">▶</a></div><div class="teaser">Here's your new Hercules, bro.</div></div><div id="thread-191579923" class="thread"><a href="https://boards.4channel.org/tv/thread/191579923"><img loading="lazy" alt="" id="thumb-191579923" class="thumb" width="150" height="74.39999999999999" src="4chan_files/1698755405154009s.jpg" data-id="191579923"></a><div title="(R)eplies / (I)mage Replies" id="meta-191579923" class="meta">R: <b>3</b><a href="https://boards.4channel.org/tv/catalog#" class="postMenuBtn" title="Thread Menu" data-post-menu="191579923">▶</a></div><div class="teaser">I just want a monsterverse movie with biollante in it already.
